Sequencer:

I wanted to create an application that focused on action music, like in john wick.


In the movie, one of the songs is called "LED spirals", so I created a spiral shader to add a super cool feel.

I added 4 looping tracks that are toggled on and off.

I added 6 different sound effects. They can be used to transition between songs or be used for adding atmosphere.

I created 3 sliders, master volume, 2 pitch scales, one for the looping sounds, one for the SFX.

The idea is just like a fun techno DJ toy anyone who is a fan of the genre or the John Wick films.
